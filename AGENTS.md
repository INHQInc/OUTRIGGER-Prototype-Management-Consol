# Claude Context Guide — OUTRIGGER Prototype Management Console

*Last updated: 2026-07-21*

> **Read first:** [`docs/LIFECYCLE-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/LIFECYCLE-ARCHITECTURE.md) (locked lifecycle model) then [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) (**current state, in-flight work, gotchas — authoritative for "where are we"**).

## What This Is

A **multi-tenant "build-and-ship layer"** for advanced web experiments — the piece the experimentation platforms (Optimizely, VWO) are weakest at: **authoring prototypes beyond the visual-editor ceiling**, previewing/getting them approved, running them as experiments, and **codifying the winner back into production source**. The operator is an agency running experiments for multiple **customer brands**.

**Repo:** `INHQInc/OUTRIGGER-Prototype-Management-Consol` (GitHub) · **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router, TS, Tailwind 4) on Vercel · Neon (hosted) / filesystem (local).

## Domain model (current)

```
Brand (Org = customer)   ← tenant; cookie opmc_org; per-customer CONNECTORS:
 ├─ GitHub connection (env GITHUB_TOKEN = console-default fallback)
 ├─ Repo registry (roles prototypes|source; providers github/azure-devops/external; per-role defaults)
 ├─ Optimizely connection (token + default project; paused drafts only)
 ├─ Sites (web properties) ← config only: environments (origin seeds "production"), loader, optional Pages
 └─ Prototypes  ← THE primary object; belongs to ONE site, targets page URL(s)
      ├─ minimal stub (Site+Name); details (hypothesis/metrics/brief) edited later; stage draft→review→live→shipped→archived
      ├─ repo ref { fullName, branch, artifactPath } picked from the registry — CODE LIVES IN THE REPO
      │    (self-contained dist/variation.js at branch HEAD; console PULLS it, never authors/pushes code)
      ├─ ArtifactVersions (immutable, SHA-pinned, carry the code snapshot)
      └─ Promotions (version → environment; append-only, governed, audited)
```

- **IA:** Dashboard (`/`, default landing: needs-attention/pipeline/live-where/activity) · Prototypes board (`/prototypes`) · workspace `/prototypes/[key]` with tabs Pipeline/Details/Settings · Sites = config · Settings section (Experimentation/Repositories/Users/Activity). See HANDOFF for the full nav.
- **Canvas: live-injection-first.** Review = the real lower env via the token-gated loader (`?opmc=<key>`) — VERIFIED WORKING on prep.outrigger.com (no CSP there). Clones/local = repo dev-harness concern or legacy Pages, never required.

## The four lifecycle principles (see LIFECYCLE-ARCHITECTURE.md)

1. **Build once, promote immutably** — a version pins a git SHA and carries its compiled code snapshot; the same bytes move staging→production.
2. **Decouple deploy from release** — exposure via flag/experiment; production promotion = a PAUSED Optimizely draft (no traffic).
3. **Govern every gate** — role-checked promotions + append-only audit trail (Brand settings → Activity).
4. **Trace end-to-end** — hypothesis → commit → experiment → shipped PR.

**Integrate, don't duplicate** — never rebuild Optimizely's stats engine / flags / targeting. Promote *into* their platform.

## Persistence — ContentStore seam

`getContentStore()` picks the backend by `DATABASE_URL` (mirrors the auth store):
- **Neon** (hosted): tables `org, org_member, site, environment, git_connection, org_repo, page_version, asset, repo_binding (legacy), prototype, prototype_overlay (orphaned), artifact_version, promotion, audit_event, experimentation_config, content_meta`.
- **Filesystem** (local, no `DATABASE_URL`): `snapshots/` tree + `_*.json` maps.

Schema **auto-migrates** on first request via a **race-safe `ddl()` helper** (create-if-not-exists / alter-add-column-if-not-exists, swallowing duplicate-object races 23505/42P07/42710). Do NOT do bare `create table if not exists` outside `ddl()` — concurrent cold starts collide on `pg_catalog`.

## Optimizely (Web Experimentation)

- **Brand-level connection** (Brand settings → Experimentation): the customer's PAT + selected project, stored server-side, **never returned to the client**. Pluggable `ExperimentationProvider` seam (Optimizely first; VWO/others slot in).
- Production promotion builds an `OptimizelyClient` from the **brand config** and creates a **paused draft** experiment pinned to the version, shipping the version's compiled overlay as custom code. Env-var path (`OPTIMIZELY_API_TOKEN`/`OPTIMIZELY_PROJECT_ID`) kept only as CLI/legacy fallback.
- **Safety rail:** experiments are created paused/draft only — a human starts them. The console NEVER turns on production traffic.
- Prep project `24138040550` (prep.outrigger.com) · Prod `21089662478` (www.outrigger.com).

## Git (connector → registry → prototype)

- Per-customer **GitHub connection** (`getGitClientForOrg`; env `GITHUB_TOKEN` = console-default fallback) feeds the **repo registry** (roles `prototypes`|`source`, providers github/azure-devops/external, per-role defaults). Each **prototype picks repo + branch** (`prototype/<key>` by convention); `resolveRepoSource` pulls the built `dist/variation.js` at branch HEAD. Console reads code; it never writes it.
- **Source role** = the brand's production codebase (Outrigger = Azure DevOps, **READ-ONLY**, `external` provider). Winners ship as a reviewed PR (GitHub sources) or a handoff bundle (external) — never an automated push. Ship step + source read-on-demand not built yet.

## Hard rules (invariants)

- **Never hardcode a brand or site.** Everything is per-tenant/per-site config from the store.
- **`~/Projects/Outrigger_Website` (Azure DevOps clone) is READ-ONLY.** Pull only; never push/commit/modify.
- **Snapshots are immutable** (PageVersion never edited; re-capture = new version). **ArtifactVersions are immutable** (append-only; carry a fixed code snapshot).
- **Brand-level config, not env vars** for new integrations (Optimizely token/project live on the org).
- **Schema changes go through `ddl()`** (race-safe).
- **Vercel deploys of cloned pages are protected** (password + noindex + robots deny) — brand clones must never be publicly crawlable.
- **Serverless constraints:** no writable FS (use the store), no `curl` (best-effort asset mirror; WAF TLS-blocks Node fetch for outrigger.com), 300s max on capture.

## Build order — current state (2026-07)

- ✅ Capture pipeline · Console UI · Auth
- ✅ **Multi-tenancy** — Brand (Org) → Sites, members + isolation, Customers management
- ✅ **ContentStore** — hosted content on Neon (was local-first)
- ✅ **Environments** · **brand-level Optimizely** · **immutable ArtifactVersions** (git-auto-pin + code snapshot)
- ✅ **Repo-sourced variations** (overlay editor removed) → loader (verified on prep) + Optimizely (production)
- ✅ **Promotion** + governance + audit · per-customer **GitHub connector** + repo registry (roles/providers)
- ✅ **Dashboard** · prototype-first IA · workspace tabs · minimal stub creation · full CRUD
- ⏳ Favorites E2E (see HANDOFF "IN FLIGHT") · starter repo scaffold · Ship step (PR/handoff via source-role repo)
- ⏳ Source read-on-demand (Azure DevOps) · env editing · multi-URL Opti targeting · version-pinned loader

## Environment variables

| Var | For |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon (hosted store) — absent → local filesystem |
| `AUTH_SECRET` / `ADMIN_EMAILS` / `ADMIN_LOGIN_SECRET` | auth |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | capture |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | git deploy / auto-pin / source reads |
| `OPTIMIZELY_API_TOKEN` / `OPTIMIZELY_PROJECT_ID` | legacy/CLI fallback (brand config preferred) |

Claude never enters credentials — the user pastes them into Vercel / the app's Brand settings.
